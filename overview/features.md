# ✨ Features

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** All features are highly customizable!\
You can tweak them to your preference in the `Config.yml` and `GrowthModifiers.yml` files.
{% endhint %}

## 🌍 Biome-Specific Plant Growth & Death

Tailor plant growth rates based on the biome they’re in!\
With `GrowthModifiers.yml`, you have control over growth speed and even the survival odds of plants in each biome, making your worlds feel more authentic and responsive to their environments.

Need more details?\
Check out the [Growth Modifiers guide](../guides/configuration/growthmodifiers.yml.md).

## 🏞️ Custom Biome Support

Bring extra depth to your Minecraft world with support for custom biomes, such as those from [Terra](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra), [Terralith Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terralith), and more.\
Realistic Plant Growth adapts to unique biome configurations, allowing you to fine-tune plant behavior for every type of biome you add to the game.

For more details, please check out the [FAQ](faq.md#which-custom-biome-plugins-generators-datapacks-are-supported).

## 🌱 Natural Survival Instincts

Add an element of risk to plant growth.\
Each time a plant progresses, there’s a chance it may perish instead of advancing — a dynamic way to simulate natural survival struggles across different biomes.

## 🪓 Tool-Specific Harvesting

In Realistic Plant Growth, using a hoe is essential to collecting crops.\
Harvest without a hoe? You’ll miss out on those valuable drops, adding a strategic element to farming.

## 🚜 Realistic Farming with Replaceable Farmland

When you harvest crops, there's a chance that tilled farmland reverts to dirt or coarse dirt, making re-tilling necessary before planting again. It’s farming, with a touch of realism!

## ☀️ Sunlight-Dependent Growth

Encourage outdoor farming by making natural sunlight essential for plant growth.\
Plants will only thrive under open skies, with an adjustable light level requirement that brings more realism to farming above ground.

## 💡 UV-Light Blocks for Indoor Farming

Give players an option for indoor farming!\
UV-light blocks act as a substitute for sunlight, enabling growth in dark, closed-off spaces—ideal for underground farms or greenhouses.

## 🌾 Boost Growth with Fertilizer

Place a composter nearby to speed up plant growth!\
As plants progress, the composter gradually depletes, requiring regular refills to sustain its effects. Automatically refill with hoppers for added convenience.

## 🚀 Quick Composter Fill

Shift-right-click on a Composter while holding a compostable item to instantly fill the composter to its maximum compost level.\
If there aren’t enough items to fully fill the composter, it will be partially filled, and all items in the player’s hand will be consumed.\
Additionally, Bonemeal now guarantees a 100% chance to increase the composter fill by 1.


## 🎶 Immersive Sounds and Effects

When a plant dies, an optional sound and visual effect can add atmosphere to your world.\
Hear and see your plants as they flourish—or fail!

## 🗨️ Customizable Messages

Personalize every player message in the plugin!\
Easily adjust or translate them through the language files, and utilize the [MiniMessage format](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) for seamless integration.

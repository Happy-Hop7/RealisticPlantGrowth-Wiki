# Feature Highlights

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** All features are highly customizable! <br>
You can tweak them to your preference in the `Config.yml` and `GrowthModifiers.yml` files.
{% endhint %}


## 🌍 Biome-Specific Plant Growth & Death

Tailor plant growth rates based on the biome they’re in! <br>
With `GrowthModifiers.yml`, you have control over growth speed and even the survival odds of plants in each biome, 
making your worlds feel more authentic and responsive to their environments.

Need more details? <br>
Check out the [Growth Modifiers guide](../guides/configuration/growthmodifiers.yml.md).


## 🏞️ Custom Biome Support

Bring extra depth to your Minecraft world with support for custom biomes, such as those from [Terra](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/Terra), [Terralith Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terralith), and more. <br>
Realistic Plant Growth adapts to unique biome configurations, allowing you to fine-tune plant behavior for every type of biome you add to the game.


## 🌱 Natural Survival Instincts

Add an element of risk to plant growth. <br>
Each time a plant progresses, there’s a chance it may perish instead of advancing — a dynamic way to simulate natural survival struggles across different biomes.


## 🪓 Tool-Specific Harvesting

In Realistic Plant Growth, using a hoe is essential to collecting crops. <br>
Harvest without a hoe? You’ll miss out on those valuable drops, adding a strategic element to farming.


## 🚜 Realistic Farming with Replaceable Farmland

When you harvest crops, there's a chance that tilled farmland reverts to dirt or coarse dirt, 
making re-tilling necessary before planting again. It’s farming, with a touch of realism!


## ☀️ Sunlight-Dependent Growth

Encourage outdoor farming by making natural sunlight essential for plant growth. <br>
Plants will only thrive under open skies, with an adjustable light level requirement that brings more realism to farming above ground.


## 💡 UV-Light Blocks for Indoor Farming

Give players an option for indoor farming! <br> 
UV-light blocks act as a substitute for sunlight, enabling growth in dark, closed-off spaces—ideal for underground farms or greenhouses.


## 🌾 Boost Growth with Fertilizer

Place a composter nearby to speed up plant growth! <br>
As plants progress, the composter gradually depletes, requiring regular refills to sustain its effects. 
Automatically refill with hoppers for added convenience.


## 🎶 Immersive Sounds and Effects

When a plant dies, an optional sound and visual effect can add atmosphere to your world. <br> 
Hear and see your plants as they flourish—or fail!

## 🗨️ Customizable Messages

Personalize every player message in the plugin! <br>
Easily adjust or translate them through the language files, and utilize the [MiniMessage format](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) for seamless integration.

## Overview

_**Realistic Plant Growth**_ is a powerful Spigot/Paper plugin that brings a new level of realism to the Minecraft flora, allowing you to fine-tune growth parameters on a per-biome basis.



* Do you want to stop Nether Wart farming or make it only work in the Nether like it used to be?
* Do you think Melon farms are too powerful and want to balance them?
* Maybe you want cocoa to grow only in jungles or make plants grow slower in deserts?
* Or perhaps you want farms to be above ground and need natural light?

&#x20;                                          **You can do all that with **_**Realistic Plant Growth**_**!**
